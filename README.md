# Errors-Per-Position

## Description
This repository is part 3 of my Error Project. It shows what MLB position makes the most errors and what position makes the most errors that lead to runs.

## Part 3.1
Part 3.1 finds the total amount of errors each position amounts to in the years 2019 to 2024.

## Part 3.2
Part 3.2 figures out the total amount of errors that lead to runs by each position.
